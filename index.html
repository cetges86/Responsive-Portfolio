                    <p>My name is Chris Etges, and I have recently begun my journey towards becoming a full
                    time web-developer. I am currently enrolled in the full-stack web development course
                    at the University of Denver. I started learning HTML and CSS through codeacademy, and continued
                    with courses through the University of Michigan online (via Coursera) in Javascript and Responsive
                    Design. I continue to learn and grow and improve my skills. I hope to become a full-time web developer
                    in front-end technologies, though once I become more familiar with backend technologies I'm hoping 
                    to be a full-stack developer. I've been interested in tech as a hobby for my entire life, and frequently
                    mess around with beta programs, and custom ROM installs on my Android devices. I'm an avid gamer, and
                    love photography and travel. You'll see a few of my website projects in my portfolio, and feel free to 
                    reach out to me for custom work or questions. Thanks!
                    </p>
